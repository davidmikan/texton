# GENERAL STRUCTURE

event:
 - sequence of predifined functions
 - composed of an ifs and a thens part
 - xml syntax: <functionname>argument1;argument2</functionname>
    important: if argument is string make "~" at the beginning

event handler:
 - manages execution of events
 - manages active and inactive events

event parser:
 - decodes xml elements and returns an event object
 - packs event objects to xml events

Sytax for objects/properties:
    [objects]: o.id(.property)
    [rooms]: r.id(.property)
    [world]: w(.property)
    [player]: p(.property)
    ex.: o.001.name
